Configuration


The mod responds to the following settings in minetest.conf:

magic_prep_cooldown: Time in seconds a player has to wait between spell
preparations. (3600)

magic_backup_interval: Time in seconds between backups of caster data. (600)

magic_starting_points: Initial number of maximum preparation points. (5)


Spells
=======

The spell system has been designed to be fairly flexible, but there are a few
opinionated choices I made.

Spell balancing is startup-based: you are encouraged
to balance your spells by making longer startups give drastically cheaper
(in spell slots) spells. Other ways to balance could include mana usage or
limiting uses (as the default configuration does), but there is special handling
of startup time.

Another one is that spells must be prepared in advance - you can only free up
spell slots periodically (by default, an hour). This still allows you to make
infinite-use spells, but players cannot change their prepared spell set very
often. Currently, however, it would be possible for a player to leave their slots
open until they need a certain spell, and then prepare it right befoer using it.
One way this could be prevented is by requiring some unique-per-player node like
an altar for spell preparation, so that players can only cheese this way in their
own home.


Spell Schools
--------------

To provide progression, this mod keeps track of aptitudes of players for different
schools of magic. You could make light spells cheaper for someone specialized
in fire magic or illusion magic, for example.


Functions
----------

magic_spells.register_spell("spell_name", {spell_def})

This registers a spell. spell_def has the following fields:

display_name - The name displayed to players

description - A description of the spell's mechanics, and possibly some
  flavortext

prep_form(metadata, "player_name") - A function that should give a formspec for requesting
  spell configuration. It gets the last chosen setup as input, so that the
  formspec can default to the previous preparation choice. You also get the
  player name, in case you need some set up for form handling.

  By default, creates a form with two fields for startup and uses, with
  names "startup" and "uses". If there is existing metadata, it uses those as
  the default value.

parse_fields({fields}, "player_name") - Parses the fields of prep_form into
  data that will be used when the spell begins casting.

  It must return two values. The first value represents the type of the result,
  and can be one of the following:

  magic_spells.error - This indicates an error. The second value must be an error
  string.

  magic_spells.incomplete - This indicates the formspec needs additional input.
  The second value can be nil or a formspec to send to the user. If it is nil,
  nothing happens.

  magic_spells.complete - This indicates that the configuration is done. The
  second value must be a parsed metadata.

  The default parser looks for fields "startup" and "uses",
  and parses them into a table of nonnegative numbers of the same names.

prep_cost({aptitudes}, metadata) - Determines the cost of a spell. The table
  aptitudes is a map from strings to nonnegative numbers, and represents the
  caster's aptitude in various schools of magic. Making your spells cheaper
  with higher aptitude is one way to introduce progression. the metadata is
  the same metadata parsed out by parse_fields.

on_begin_cast(metadata, player, pointed_thing, func(startup, result_data)) -
  This is called when a player begins casting a spell. You should account for
  pointed_thing being nil, in case a player casts something without pointing
  at anything. The function argument is a callback, that you should call when
  you wish to initiate casting. Most spells will probably call it after validating
  the spell cast, but if you want additional casting-time configuration you
  could call it from a formspec callback as well, for example. The result_data
  will be passed to on_finish_cast.

  The return value should be nil if the spell should be unprepared, for example if
  it runs out of uses. Otherwise, the function should return a new metadata, which
  will replace the old one. To keep the old metadata, you can return it unchanged.

  By default, it takes as metadata with nonnegative integer values with keys
  "startup" and "uses". "uses" may alternatively be nil, which indicates infinite
  use. After making sure there are enough uses left, it calls the callback with the
  given startup, and passing the player's name and pointed_thing in a table with
  keys "player_name" and "pointed_thing" respectively.

on_finish_cast(result_data) - This carries out the spells effect. It receives
  the result_data passed into the callback by on_begin_cast.

metadata should be serializable by minetest.serialize.


magic_spells.give_spell("player_name", "spell_name")

This spell grants the player knowledge of the given spell. Returns nil on
success, otherwise returns an error string.


magic_spells.take_spell("player_name", "spell_name")

This spell revokes knowledge of a spell. Returns nil on success, otherwise
returns an error string.


magic_spells.get_prepared_meta("player_name", "spell_name")

Gets a shallow copy of the metadata saved for a given spell preparation, or nil
if it has not been prepared.


magic_spells.set_prepared_meta("player_name", "spell_name", meta)

Sets the player's metadata for a spell preparation, or unprepares the spell if
nil is given.


magic_spells.prepare_spells("player_name")

Sends the player the preparation dialog.


magic_spells.reset_preparation("player_name", force)

Resets the player to an unprepared state, with full preparation slots. If
force is true, the function will ignore any remaining preparation cooldown.
Returns nil on success, otherwise an error string.


magic_spells.cast(player, pointed_thing, "spell_name")

Casts a spell from a player's prepared spells. pointed_thing may be nil. On
success it returns nil, otherwise returns an error string.


magic_spells.force_cast(player, pointed_thing, "spell_name", meta)

Forces a player to cast a spell, with the given meta, regardless of preparation
state.


magic_spells.cancel_cast("player_name")

Makes the player cancel the spell they are currently casting. Returns nil
on success, otherwise returns an error string.


magic_spells.get_current_spell("player_name")

Gets the spell a player is currently casting. If the player is not casting a
spell, it returns nil.
